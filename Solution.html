					<h3>I. The Worldwide Response</h3>
					<p>
						For something as gravely serious as the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest, the Brazilian government’s response was anything but responsible. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro fired Ricardo Magnus Osorio Galvao, the director of the National Institute for Research for reporting the 77% increase of forest fires, and claimed the numbers were fake. He mocked pro-environment groups and then jokingly called himself “Captain Chainsaw” as he claimed the INPE results inaccurate. He claimed that Galvao was using the data for an “anti-Brazil campaign”. He has also refused assistance from international leaders, like French president Emmanuel Macron, who Bolsonaro accused of having a ‘sensationalist tone’ and interference of what he seems to be a local matter. 

						Similarly, Bolsonaro’s foreign minister Ernesto Araujo agrees with Jair and blames the international forces for manipulating the environmental crisis. In addition, General Eduardo Villas Boas, the Brazilian Army’s former commander, criticizes world leaders like Macron and Trudeau for “directly challenging Brazilian sovereignty”.

						With the sudden appearance of worldwide backlash, Bolsonaro appeared to be more willing to take productive steps against the fires since August 23, saying he and the government would take “zero tolerance” to environmental crimes. He then signed several decrees for helping the Amazon, including one where setting fires in Brazil is banned for 60 days starting on August 28. From then on, the Bolsonaro government received help from Chile, the United Kingdom , Canada, and others. 

						The international powers have not picked up on the recent action, though. The EU-Mercosur free Trade Agreement states that Brazilian trade will be halted until they protect the environment with full commitment. The Finnish Minister of Finance, Mika Lintila, suggested to ban Brazilian beef until the country finally acted to stop the deforestation.

						Certain environmentalist celebrities also jumped in the event. Restauranteurs reported to be going vegan, and some other celebrities urged their audience to eat a plant-based diet to help the cause. Bernard Arnault, Europe’s richest man, sent out a huge sum of money to donate to the cause .

					<h3>II. Global Relevance and Possible Solutions</h3>
					<p>It is common knowledge at this point that the atmosphere is a vital part of human life, being the only thing that is able to give us life-bearing gases. We can then then safely say that whatever may be creating this air, we have to protect. And actually, we know who is responsible for giving us this extremely essential air. Trees take our carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen we need. And the place that is one of the most densely populated with trees is the forests, namely, the Amazon Rainforest. And we believe with absolute certainty when we say that saving the Amazon will greatly benefit us in the long term. 

					One of the best things to do first when planning to support the efforts to save the Amazon is to do your research. Look into the facts, what led to the fires, how to stop and avoid them in the first place, most of which we have already told you, or about to tell you. It’s very important to have your own standpoint that is backed up by facts, and which you can use later, when you choose systems to support.

					The next thing you may want to do, is to spread awareness. Social media is a very effective platform, but practice caution in the deep sea of fake news. Tell the masses about what you’ve researched, what you’ve found, and how they can help as well. You can even direct them to some donations that help the cause. In the end, yes, 2 heads are better than one, but 100 are better than both. 

					Next, be part of the change. Contribute to environmental outreaches, participate in them. You can even sign in several petitions. If you don’t have the necessary resources, don’t have enough money, or even, don’t want to leave the house, you can always help by planting a few trees. All you need is a bit of time, seeds, a spade, and good intent.
