					<h3>I. What is the Amazon Rainforest?</h3>
					<p>The Amazon Rainforest is a 5.5 million square meter rainforest situated in the middle of South America,
					surrounding countries like Brazil, Suriname, Colombia, and Peru. Millions of undescribed species, in the tens of thousands, even, are waiting to be found.
					This rainforest is primarily known for it’s jaw-dropping biodiversity. The rainforest is home to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>More than 40,000 plant species</li>
						<li>3,000 freshwater fish species, and</li>
						<li>More than 370 reptilian species.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Amazon Rainforest provides massive protecton against global warming. Its various trees protect the Earth’s surface from getting any warmer,
					and kilograms of life-bearing oxygen are produced every day. The rainforest is home to millions of people, indigenous and ethnic groups.
					The biodiversity also leads to traditional agriculture, natural clothing, and natural medicines. </p>

					<h3>II. Amazon Forest Fires</h3>
					<p>In the turn of the new year, January 2019, multitudinous forest wildfires started spreading around the edges of the rainforest.
					As of September 21, 906,000 hectares have completely burned. The cause seems to be environmentally destructivve approaches to agriculture and climate change.
					The fires spread sporadically, heating up the entirety of the Southern America, contributing to global warming.

					Harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, which are emitted by the rapidly multiplying fires, spread across the Earth’s atmosphere,
					and kill a lot of species and greatly reduce our only planet’s biodiversity. The low air pressures of the fire can lead to gales and storms.
					The combined storms and sporadic temperature changes, not to mention the leftover ashes, wastes, and burnt animal corpses, contributes to worldwide pollution, and will inevitably lead to climate change.

					As of now, the fires continue to spread into the core of the Amazon, and it shows no signs of stopping. Compared to 2018, there has been a 77% increment of fires in 2019.
					Brazil’s National Institute for Research has detected 39,194 fires in the Amazon Rainforest between January to August. Unless the right people take action, the epidemic can only go forward, even accelerate.
