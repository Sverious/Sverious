			<p>This webpage focuses on protecting the environment and the nature mainly in the issue of the burning of Amazon. The Amazon consists of thousands of plant and animals species, some of them were
			endemic in the forest. The Amazon rainforest produces roughly 6% of the world's oxygen, 6% might be small a number but the safety of all living beings is at risk. Global warming and Climate change can 
			affect the lifestyle of the living beings. Negligence of this issue might result to worse consequences we will face later on.
